	  networks.
	- Fixed bug when trying to start wicd multiple times.

	- Fixed wicd-daemon crash when child_pid is undefined, thanks to
	  David Cantrell.

1.7.1:
	Changes for Packagers:
	- You will now want to use the --python option to setup.py configure to 
	  make sure the right Python (python2.x) is used. With the Python 3
	  transition in progress, the lack of uniformity across distros made it 
	  difficult to find a solution that works everywhere. As a result, the 
	  python executable path can be set (for subprocesses launched by Wicd)
	  with the --python option to setup.py configure, and patching of the
	  shebang lines may be required if `which python` is not python2.x.
	- If you handle translations in your packaging process, setup.py now
	  needs 'pybabel' and 'xgettext' binaries. Please provide them during
	  the build process.
	- setup.py now accepts three more parameters: --dbus-service=, --systemd=
	  and --logrotate=. Please set them accordingly to the paths of your
	  distribution.

	Major Changes:
	- (New) upstream author: David Paleino :)
	- The translations are now handled by Rosetta, in Launchpad.
	- Implemented support for wired connections needing authentication with
	  wpa_supplicant (thanks Joe MacMahon!)
	- Support 'Never show networks' (thanks Robin Becker!)
	- Mask out sensitive information in the logfile (CVE-2012-0813)

	Minor Changes:
	- Now uses gtkbuilder instead of libglade
	- Fixed bug in script macro expansion
	- Fixed typo in EAP-fast template
	- Applied 1 patch from Archlinux (thanks RÃ©my Oudompheng)
	  - Fixed Python 2.7 support
	  - Works if Python3 is the default Python
	- Applied 14 patches from Debian (big thank you to everyone
							who contributed):
	  - Includes translations in source tarball
	  - Improved documentation
	  - Fixed resolv.conf permissions
	  - Ignore configparser errors
	  - Several others, please see CHANGES for more details
	- Proper localization of all the code has been put in place -- every part
	  of the UIs and the daemon should be translated/translatable now!
	- Fixed various bugs with 'unicode in ESSID' handling
	- Implemented rfkill-support
	- Generalized libc linking using ctypes' find_library()
	- Fixed wireless connecting status message, now shows the correct ESSID
	- Support wifi-channels with more than 2 digits
	- Implemented in-GUI password hiding
	- Implemented -t/--tray to only run the wicd-gtk tray icon
	- Support alternative ifconfig output style

1.7.0:
	Changes for Packagers:
	- Wicd now supports a -k option, which should be run by the init script
	  when the daemon is stopped to release the DHCP lease but should not
	  be run on a restart of the daemon.
	- The ability has been added to split Wicd's components into multiple
	  directories. Use --gtk, --cli, --curses, and --daemon to
	  setup.py configure to specify the locations of the respective
	  components.
	- The preferred way to run the GTK UI is now to use wicd-gtk, not
	  wicd-client. wicd-gtk is a new addition to 1.7 that will never
	  run wicd-curses. wicd-client will automatically decide to run
	  wicd-curses if there is no X session available.

	Major Changes:
	- Connection information is available by right clicking the tray icon
	- Can set the hostname per network for all DHCP clients
	- urwid 0.9.9 is now supported
	- Added wicd-cli, a command line interface for use in scripts
	- Global scripts are now passed parameters specifying the network

	Minor Changes:
	- Support for only displaying notifications using -o to wicd-client
	- Reconnecting now works when measuring signal strength in dBm
	- ESSIDs made of numbers now work properly
	- All valid wpa_supplicant drivers are now displayed
	- Wired network is now displayed while scanning wireless networks
	- Added wicd-gtk, a command to always and only run the GTK UI
	- Marked ioctl backend not supported
	- Use dhcpcd-bin on Debian instead of dhcpcd script

	Minor Changes:

	Major Changes:

	  previous one

	Minor Changes and Other Enhancements:
	- Better autoconnection behavior
	- Tray/GUI will survive the daemon being killed
	- Reasons for connection failures will now bubble back to the GUI
	- Add/remove wired profile system is now more user-friendly
	- Support for using resolvconf instead of directly editing /etc/resolv.conf
	- Wicd won't blindly kill dhcp clients / wpa_supplicant any more
	- Added an option to automatically switch from a wireless network to a wired 
	  one as soon as a cable is plugged in
	- Moved scanning to its own thread, which makes GUI and daemon more responsive
	  during scans
	- Made it possible to specify macros in script entries
	- The GUI will now display the encryption entry dialog if you attempt to 
	  connect to an encrypted network without entering a password
	- Static gateway entry is now optional
	- Passwords with leading or trailing whitespace are now stored properly
	- Many init/config script, man page, and setup.py fixes/updates, including
	  better autodetection of file placement with regard to sleep hooks and 
	  KDE autostart files (thanks to Robby Workman)
